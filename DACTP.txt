Decentralized Agentic Compliance & Trust Protocol (DACTP)

IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION:
DACTP is a PROTOCOL, not a consumer application.
What is built in this project is:
1) The DACTP protocol (core smart contracts)
2) A reference lending demo that CONSUMES the protocol
This demo exists only to prove the protocol works on testnet.

--------------------------------------------------

🧩 Problem Being Solved (Real, Non-Generic, Unsolved)

Modern financial systems rely on trust, delegation, and behavioral history.
Web3 systems largely do not.

Current DeFi limitations:
- Over-collateralization is mandatory
- No persistent, cross-app reputation
- No native delegation with accountability
- No way to express “limited trust” on-chain

This blocks:
- Under-collateralized lending
- Credit-based financial primitives
- Agent-driven automation with accountability
- Real-world financial adoption

--------------------------------------------------

🎯 What DACTP Does (Protocol Definition)

DACTP is a decentralized trust and delegation layer for Stellar/Soroban.

It provides:
1) On-chain reputation as a first-class primitive
2) Revocable, scoped agent delegation
3) Deterministic reputation updates based on financial behavior
4) A reusable protocol that any Stellar dApp can integrate

DACTP does NOT:
- Issue tokens
- Perform lending itself
- Perform KYC
- Make subjective trust decisions

It only enforces rules.

--------------------------------------------------

🧠 Core Concepts

1️⃣ Reputation (On-Chain Risk Allowance)

- Reputation is NOT social trust
- Reputation is NOT voting-based
- Reputation represents how much financial risk the protocol allows

Properties:
- Stored on-chain
- Objective
- Deterministic
- Event-driven
- Non-editable by users

Reputation scale:
0 – 100

Initial reputation:
50 (neutral, unproven user)

--------------------------------------------------

2️⃣ Agentic Delegation

Users can create agents with:
- Limited permissions (scopes)
- Spending limits
- Expiry
- Revocation

Example:
“Agent A can repay loans up to 10 XLM for the next 30 days.”

Agents do NOT own funds.
Agents execute actions on behalf of users under strict rules.

--------------------------------------------------

💡 Reputation Update Logic (MVP-Level)

Reputation updates are triggered ONLY by financial outcomes.

Positive event:
Loan repayment completed
→ +5 reputation

Negative event:
Loan default / missed repayment
→ −15 reputation

Severe event:
Fraud / malicious behavior
→ reputation frozen (no more delegation)

Key rule:
Reputation increases slowly and decreases quickly.
This mirrors real credit systems.

--------------------------------------------------

🧪 Reference Use Case (For Demonstration Only)

To demonstrate DACTP on testnet, we build a small reference dApp:
An under-collateralized micro-lending demo.

This demo:
- Is NOT the product
- Is NOT the protocol
- Simply consumes DACTP

Any other app (insurance, remittance, payroll, SME lending) could use DACTP the same way.

--------------------------------------------------

🛠 Why Stellar + Soroban

- Ultra-low fees → frequent reputation checks are viable
- Fast finality → agent automation is practical
- Soroban contracts → enforce delegation and reputation rules on-chain
- Stellar ecosystem focus → real finance, inclusion, infrastructure

--------------------------------------------------

USP (Why This Is Different)

- Reputation is enforceable, not cosmetic
- Delegation is permissioned and revocable
- Trust is protocol-level, not app-level
- Enables under-collateralized finance without custody or oracles
