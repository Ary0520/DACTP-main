ntegrate Freighter with a React dapp
Wallets are an essential part of any dapp. They allow users to interact with the blockchain and sign transactions. In this section, you'll learn how to integrate the Freighter wallet into your React dapps.

WalletData Component
In the example crowdfund dapp, the WalletData component plays a key role in wallet integration. Let's break down the code and understand its functionality:

/components/moleculres/wallet-data/index.tsx
import React from "react";
import { useAccount, useIsMounted } from "../../../hooks";
import { ConnectButton } from "../../atoms";
import styles from "./style.module.css";

export function WalletData() {
  const mounted = useIsMounted();
  const account = useAccount();

  return (
    <>
      {mounted && account ? (
        <div className={styles.displayData}>
          <div className={styles.card}>{account.displayName}</div>
        </div>
      ) : (
        <ConnectButton label="Connect Wallet" />
      )}
    </>
  );
}

Here's a breakdown of the code:

The mounted variable is obtained using the useIsMounted hook, indicating whether the component is currently mounted or not.
The useAccount hook is used to fetch the user's account data, and the data property is destructured from the result.
Conditional rendering is used to display different content based on the component's mount status and the availability of account data.
If the component is mounted and the account data is available, the user's wallet data is displayed. This includes the account's display name.
If the component is not mounted or the account data is not available, a ConnectButton component is rendered, allowing the user to connect with Freighter.

Sign authorization entries
In order to take advantage of contract authorization, you can use Freighter's API to sign an authorization entry. A good example of how signing an authorization entry works can be found in the authorizeEntry helper of stellar-sdk.

Like in the helper, you can construct a HashIdPreimageSorobanAuthorization and use the xdr representation of that structure to call await freighterApi.signAuthEntry(preimageXdr). This call will return a Buffer of the signed hash of the HashIdPreimageSorobanAuthorization passed in, which can then be used to submit to the network during a contract authorization workflow.
______________________________________________
Prompt Freighter to sign transactions as a JS dapp developer
If you're building a JS dapp, easily sign Soroban transactions using the Freighter browser extension and its corresponding client library @stellar/freighter-api:

Follow the setup instructions to connect to the Testnet, if required during development.

Now, you can use the signTransaction method from @stellar/freighter-api in your dapp to sign Soroban XDRs using the account in Freighter.

Upon calling signTransaction, Freighter will open and prompt the user to sign the transaction. Approving the transaction will return an object containing the signed XDR to the requesting dapp.
______________________________________________
Send Soroban token payments
Once you have added a Soroban token to your Freighter wallet, you can now send a payment of that token directly from Freighter.

On the Freighter account screen, click the Send icon in the upper part of the screen.

Enter a recipient public key. Click Continue.

Select your token from the asset list at the bottom of the screen and enter a token amount. Click Continue.

Enter a memo (optional). Click Review Send.

Review the details of your payment. Click Send.
______________________________________________
Sign Soroban XDRs
With a funded Testnet account, you can now sign Soroban XDRs using dApps that are integrated with Freighter. An example of an integrated dApp is Stellar's Lab.

On the Lab's transaction signer, enter a Soroban XDR into the form field.

Click Sign with Freighter.

Freighter will open with the details of the XDR. Click Approve to sign or Reject to dismiss without a signature.

If approved, Freighter will transmit a signed XDR back to the Lab.
______________________________________________
Enable Soroban tokens
With a funded Stellar account, you can now add Soroban tokens to your Freighter wallet.

On the Freighter account screen, click this Manage assets button in the ... options dropdown in the top left of the screen.

You will now see a button to Add an asset at the bottom of the screen. Click this Add an asset button.

On the next screen, enter the Token ID of the token you want to add to Freighter and click the Add button when it appears. Click Confirm to add it to your wallet.

You will now see your token's balance on Freighter's account page. Clicking on the balance will show a history of payments sent using this token.

React + Freighter + Soroban (CORE SNIPPETS)

Below are the exact patterns used in:

soroban-react-atomic-swap

soroban-react-payment

Just stripped down.

A. Detect & connect Freighter wallet
import {
  isConnected,
  requestAccess,
  getAddress,
} from "@stellar/freighter-api";

export async function connectWallet() {
  const connected = await isConnected();
  if (!connected) throw new Error("Freighter not installed");

  await requestAccess(); // popup
  const address = await getAddress();

  return address;
}


Usage:

const address = await connectWallet();
console.log("Connected:", address);

B. Build a Soroban transaction (invoke contract)
import {
  SorobanRpc,
  TransactionBuilder,
  Contract,
  nativeToScVal,
  Networks,
} from "@stellar/stellar-sdk";

const rpc = new SorobanRpc.Server(
  import.meta.env.VITE_RPC_URL
);

export async function buildContractTx(
  publicKey,
  contractId
) {
  const sourceAccount = await rpc.getAccount(publicKey);

  const contract = new Contract(contractId);

  const tx = new TransactionBuilder(sourceAccount, {
    fee: "100000",
    networkPassphrase: Networks.FUTURENET,
  })
    .addOperation(
      contract.call(
        "swap", // or "transfer", "lock", etc
        nativeToScVal(100, { type: "i128" })
      )
    )
    .setTimeout(30)
    .build();

  return tx;
}

C. Sign transaction with Freighter
import { signTransaction } from "@stellar/freighter-api";

export async function signTx(tx) {
  const signedXdr = await signTransaction(
    tx.toXDR(),
    {
      networkPassphrase:
        "Test SDF Future Network ; October 2022",
    }
  );

  return signedXdr;
}

D. Submit transaction to Soroban RPC
export async function submitTx(signedXdr) {
  const tx = TransactionBuilder.fromXDR(
    signedXdr,
    Networks.FUTURENET
  );

  const result = await rpc.sendTransaction(tx);
  return result;
}

E. Full call flow (what atomic-swap & payment apps do)
const user = await connectWallet();

const tx = await buildContractTx(
  user,
  CONTRACT_ID
);

const signed = await signTx(tx);

const result = await submitTx(signed);

console.log("TX RESULT:", result);

Contract Deployment & Address Management (CLI + frontend usage)
A. Build the Soroban contract (Rust → WASM)
stellar contract build


This generates:

target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/your_contract.wasm

B. Deploy contract to Testnet

▶️ Testnet
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/your_contract.wasm \
  --source YOUR_SECRET_KEY \
  --rpc-url https://rpc-testnet.stellar.org \
  --network-passphrase "Test SDF Network ; September 2015"

  ▶️ Futurenet 
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/your_contract.wasm \
  --source YOUR_SECRET_KEY \
  --rpc-url https://rpc-futurenet.stellar.org \
  --network-passphrase "Test SDF Future Network ; October 2022"
